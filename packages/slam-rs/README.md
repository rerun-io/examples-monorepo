# slam-rs

Visual-inertial odometry with a Rust core. The estimator is a port of the
basalt VIO fork: pure Rust, CPU first, N-camera from the start. Python owns the
plumbing — catalog feed, decode, evaluation and Rerun logging — and talks to the
core through a PyO3 extension module.

## Core modules

The core is being filled in stage by stage, bottom up. What is in it today:

| Module | What it is |
|---|---|
| `lie` | `So3`/`Se3` over any `f32`/`f64` scalar: Sophus's `exp`/`log`, the adjoint, basalt's four SO(3) Jacobians and their inverses, the decoupled SE(3) pair, and the left-multiplied pose increment the estimator runs on. |
| `types` | `TimeCamId`, `KeypointId`/`LandmarkId`, `AbsOrderMap`, `PoseState`/`PoseVelState`/`PoseVelBiasState` and the two fixed-linearization wrappers. |
| `config` | basalt's `VioConfig`, read straight from `data/**/*_config.json`. |
| `calib` | basalt's `Calibration`: extrinsics, the six shipped camera models, the 9- and 12-parameter IMU bias calibrations, plus a constructor that takes what the Python catalog feed reports. |
| `camera` | `pinhole`, `kb4` and `pinhole-radtan8` with basalt's 4-D homogeneous `project`/`unproject` and their analytic Jacobians (2x4 point, 2xN parameter, 4x2 and 4xN for unprojection), the `rpmax` and `z >= epsilonSqrt` domain checks, and a `CameraEnum` that dispatches without a vtable. `ds`, `eucm` and `ucm` parse but are rejected here. |
| `image` | `ImageU16`: an owned flat 16-bit frame with an explicit row stride, the stride-aware `u8 << 8` widening basalt's readers do, and `interp`/`interp_grad`/`in_bounds` reproduced from `image.h` in the same arithmetic order. |
| `pyramid` | The `PyramidBuilder` stage seam with an associated `Pyramid` type that lends nothing (geometry plus a copy into the caller's buffer), `PyramidU16` (one flat buffer per level, not basalt's packed mipmap) and `CpuPyramidBuilder`, whose `subsample` is bit-exact with `image_pyr.h:99-140`. |

One thing the camera port inherits and the frontend does live with:
`unproject` runs a fixed three (kb4) or five (radtan8) Newton steps, and on wide
calibrations that is not always enough. Inside basalt's own
`optical_flow_image_safe_radius` nine of the ten shipped cameras invert to 1e-11;
msd-g2 cam2 is off by 0.12 in bearing *inside* that radius, and RoboCap cam1
outside it returns a bearing pointing backwards. basalt's C++ returns the same
numbers to the last figure, so this is a property of the algorithm, not of the
port; `crates/slam-rs/tests/camera_jacobians.rs` pins all three cases.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `crates/slam-rs` | The core (`slam_rs` lib). No Python, no Rerun, no GPU. |
| `crates/slam-rs-py` | PyO3 `cdylib` built in place as `slam_rs/_core.so`. |
| `crates/slam-rs-cli` | `slam-rs` binary: a placeholder. `version` is the only subcommand that does anything; a replay runs through the Python tools. |
| `slam_rs/` | The Python package: stubs, Tyro entry points under `apis/`. |
| `tools/` | Thin CLI shims over `slam_rs/apis/`. |

`Cargo.lock` is committed. `cargo` never runs during `pixi lock` or
`pixi install`: the build is an explicit, cached pixi task.

## Build and gates

```bash
pixi run -e slam-rs-dev --frozen slam-rs-build      # cargo build + install _core.so in place
pixi run -e slam-rs-dev --frozen tests              # pytest (depends on the build)
pixi run -e slam-rs-dev --frozen lint               # ruff
pixi run -e slam-rs-dev --frozen typecheck          # pyrefly
pixi run -e slam-rs-dev --frozen deadcode           # vulture
pixi run -e slam-rs-dev --frozen slam-rs-clippy     # cargo clippy -D warnings
pixi run -e slam-rs-dev --frozen slam-rs-rust-test  # cargo test --workspace
pixi run -e slam-rs-dev --frozen slam-rs-version    # print the core version
```
